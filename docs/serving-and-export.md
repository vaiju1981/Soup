## Merge LoRA Adapter

Merge a LoRA adapter with its base model into a standalone model:

```bash
# Auto-detect base model from adapter_config.json
soup merge --adapter ./output --output ./merged

# Specify base model and dtype
soup merge --adapter ./output --base meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B --dtype bfloat16
```


## Export to GGUF

Export models to GGUF format for use with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp):

```bash
# Export LoRA adapter (auto-merges with base, then converts)
soup export --model ./output --format gguf --quant q4_k_m

# Export with different quantizations
soup export --model ./output --format gguf --quant q8_0
soup export --model ./output --format gguf --quant f16

# Export a full (already merged) model
soup export --model ./merged --format gguf

# Specify llama.cpp path manually
soup export --model ./output --format gguf --llama-cpp /path/to/llama.cpp
```

Supported quantizations: `q4_0`, `q4_k_m`, `q5_k_m`, `q8_0`, `f16`, `f32`

### Building llama.cpp (required for quantized GGUF)

Soup auto-clones llama.cpp (pinned tag `b5270`) to `~/.soup/llama.cpp` on first use,
but it does **not** build it. The conversion step (`f16` / `f32`) works from the
Python script alone; every *quantized* type additionally needs the `llama-quantize`
binary, so build it once:

```bash
cd ~/.soup/llama.cpp
cmake -B build -DGGML_NATIVE=OFF -DLLAMA_CURL=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release --target llama-quantize -j 4
```

Soup finds the binary in both single-config (`build/bin/llama-quantize`, Make/Ninja)
and multi-config (`build/bin/Release/llama-quantize.exe`, MSVC/Xcode) layouts, or on
`PATH`. Point at an existing checkout with `--llama-cpp /path/to/llama.cpp` or the
`LLAMA_CPP_PATH` env var.

**Toolchain validated on Windows** (all six quants, then `soup deploy ollama` →
inference): Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools with the *Desktop development with C++*
workload (`Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64`) + CMake ≥ 3.14, CPU-only.
Linux/macOS need only a C++ toolchain + CMake. CUDA llama.cpp builds are untested
(see [#144](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/issues/144)).

> Do **not** run `pip install -r ~/.soup/llama.cpp/requirements.txt` — it pins
> `torch~=2.2.1` against the CPU wheel index and will downgrade a CUDA PyTorch,
> breaking training. Soup deliberately installs only the convert script's extra
> dependencies (`gguf`, `sentencepiece`, `protobuf`), unpinned.

### ONNX Export

Export models to ONNX format for use with [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/):

```bash
pip install "soup-cli[onnx]"
soup export --model ./output --format onnx
soup export --model ./output --format onnx --output ./model_onnx
```

### TensorRT-LLM Export

Export models to TensorRT-LLM format for high-throughput GPU inference:

```bash
pip install "soup-cli[tensorrt]"
soup export --model ./output --format tensorrt
soup export --model ./output --format tensorrt --output ./model_trt
```

`pip install tensorrt_llm` pins its own `torch`/`transformers`/`numpy`/`datasets`
versions, which can downgrade a training environment's stack. Install it in a
separate environment from the one you trained in, and export there.

### BitNet 1.58 TQ1_0 GGUF Export (live in v0.71.20)

Export a BitNet 1.58-bit model as a `TQ1_0` (1.58-bit ternary) GGUF via
llama.cpp's convert→quantize pipeline. Both the `bitnet` alias and the explicit
`tq1_0` flavour map to the same `TQ1_0` quantization (no importance matrix is
needed — ternary weights export directly):

```bash
soup export --model ./output --format bitnet   # → TQ1_0 ternary GGUF
soup export --model ./output --format tq1_0     # same flavour
soup export --model ./output --format bitnet --llama-cpp /path/to/llama.cpp
```

A built llama.cpp toolchain is required; LoRA adapters are auto-merged before
export. See [Performance & Quantization → BitNet](performance-and-quantization.md)
for the training side.

After export, use with Ollama manually or auto-deploy:
```bash
# Manual (3-step)
echo 'FROM ./my-model.q4_k_m.gguf' > Modelfile
ollama create my-model -f Modelfile
ollama run my-model

# Auto-deploy (1-step)
soup export --model ./output --format gguf --deploy ollama --deploy-name my-model
```

### Deploy to Ollama

Deploy a GGUF model directly to your local [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) instance:

```bash
# Deploy a GGUF model
soup deploy ollama --model ./output/model.q4_k_m.gguf --name soup-my-model

# Deploy with system prompt and parameters
soup deploy ollama --model ./model.gguf --name soup-chat \
  --system "You are a helpful assistant." \
  --template chatml \
  --parameter temperature=0.7 \
  --parameter top_p=0.9

# Export + deploy in one command
soup export --model ./output --format gguf --deploy ollama

# List Soup-deployed models
soup deploy ollama --list

# Remove a model
soup deploy ollama --remove soup-my-model
```

Auto-detected chat templates: `chatml`, `llama`, `mistral`, `vicuna`, `zephyr` (or `auto` to infer from soup.yaml).


## Batch Inference

Run a model on a list of prompts and save results:

```bash
# JSONL input (each line: {"prompt": "..."})
soup infer --model ./output --input prompts.jsonl --output results.jsonl

# Plain text input (one prompt per line)
soup infer --model ./output --input prompts.txt --output results.jsonl

# Custom generation settings
soup infer --model ./output --input prompts.jsonl --output results.jsonl \
  --max-tokens 512 --temperature 0.3
```

Output is JSONL with `prompt`, `response`, and `tokens_generated` fields. Shows a progress bar and throughput summary.

`--device cpu` / `mps` / `cuda` / `cuda:1` loads the whole model onto that device, here and in `soup chat`, `soup diff` and `soup serve`. Without `--device`, transformers places the model (`device_map="auto"`), sharding it across GPUs when there are several. Before this, those commands loaded with `device_map="auto"` whatever `--device` said, so `--device cpu` on a Mac still ran on MPS.


## Inference Benchmarking

Quickly measure your model's generation speed and memory footprint before deployment:

```bash
# Benchmark local speed and VRAM usage on 3 automatically generated prompts
soup bench ./output

# Customizing benchmarking parameters
soup bench ./output --num-prompts 5 --max-tokens 256

# Use custom prompts from a text file (one per line) or JSONL
soup bench ./output --prompts-file my_prompts.txt
soup bench ./output --prompts-file bench_suite.jsonl
```

This acts as a built-in "speedometer," outputting Tokens-Per-Second (TPS), Total Latency, and Peak VRAM allocations into a clean status table.

`soup bench <model>` is shorthand for `soup bench infer <model>`; both take the same flags.

### Training benchmark

`soup bench train` runs a short, fixed-length SFT job from your config and writes a JSON report.
It exists so a throughput number carries evidence that the model was training while it was
measured (#836):

```bash
soup bench train --config soup.yaml --steps 20 --warmup 3 -o bench-train.json
```

The run trains for exactly `--steps` optimizer steps, logs every step, saves nothing, and writes
into a scratch directory, not the config's `output`. The first `--warmup` steps are measured but
left out of the timing. It measures `task: sft` on the transformers backend and refuses any other
task or backend by name.

It exits **1** in two different ways, and only one of them leaves a report:

- **Pre-flight refusals write no report.** A task or backend it does not measure, `--steps` not
  above `--warmup`, and a model with zero trainable parameters are all refused before training
  starts. Nothing is written to `-o`; the reason is printed.
- **Post-run check failures write the report**, with `valid: false` and one entry per failed
  check in `failures`. A run that did not train is a result, and the file keeps the evidence.

The checks, all run on the finished report (`trainable_parameters` is also the pre-flight
refusal above, so in ordinary use it fires there and writes nothing):

| check | fails when |
|---|---|
| `trainable_parameters` | no `requires_grad` tensor has real storage (`meta` ones are counted apart). Checked before training too, because the Trainer would otherwise die in autograd without naming the cause |
| `grad_norm` | a counted step logged `grad_norm == 0.0` or a non-finite norm. A backend that logs no norm is `"not reported by this backend"`, never `0.0` |
| `parameters_changed` | the trainable parameters are bit-identical before the first step and after the last. This check needs no `grad_norm`, so it also covers backends that log none |
| `step_count` | fewer optimizer steps ran than were requested |

Only post-warm-up steps are checked for `grad_norm`. Under fp16 the GradScaler can skip its first
steps on overflow and log a non-finite norm; raise `--warmup` past them rather than reading that
as divergence.

Report fields:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `valid`, `failures` | the verdict, and one `{check, message}` per failed check |
| `checks` | `trainable_parameters` (count), `grad_norm` (state), `parameters_changed` (bool) |
| `timing` | `median_seconds`, `p95_seconds` (nearest-rank), `counted_steps`, `warmup_steps_discarded`, `total_seconds`, and `step_seconds`: every counted step's time in run order, so a run that changed mode mid-flight shows where |
| `tokens` | `useful` (supervised: `labels != -100`), `total`, and `utilisation` (`useful / total`), counted from the batches `training_step` received |
| `throughput` | `useful_tokens_per_second` and `total_tokens_per_second` |
| `memory` | `max_memory_allocated_bytes` and `max_memory_reserved_bytes`, kept separate and read after `reset_peak_memory_stats`. Both are `null` off CUDA. Never read from `nvidia-smi` |
| `provenance` | device, card, CUDA runtime, compute capability, driver version, SM clock during the counted steps (`sm_clock_mhz_busy`: `min`, `median`, `max` and `sample_count` of `nvidia-smi` samples kept only from the post-warm-up steps. Queries start on a 100 ms schedule, and a slower query skips ticks. Each is timestamped at the midpoint of its query, taken for torch's own device by PCI bus id (nvidia-smi's first GPU when torch does not report one); memory is never read this way. With no sample in the window the numbers are `null`, and `unavailable_reason` says why: `"not a CUDA run"`, `"no nvidia-smi tool found"`, `"nvidia-smi returned no readable SM clock"`, or `"no sample fell inside the counted steps"` (a run too short for the schedule). It is `null` whenever there are numbers), platform, Python, package versions (torch, transformers, peft, trl, bitsandbytes, accelerate), dtype, optimizer, seed, data seed |
| `config_hash`, `resolved_config` | sha256 of the fully resolved config, and the config itself, so a schema-default change that moves a run shows up (#716) |
| `steps_requested`, `steps_measured` | what was asked for and what ran |

A step's time runs from the previous step's end to its own end, so data loading counts. The first
step runs from its own start. On CUDA each boundary is read after `torch.cuda.synchronize()`.
`parameters_changed` proves that something moved, not that the model learned anything useful. It
is a floor, not a quality gate.


## Inference Server

`--auto-quant` currently refuses with exit code 2. Soup cannot compare GGUF, AWQ,
GPTQ, FP8, and an unquantized baseline before a serving engine has loaded them;
timing an unevaluated stub would make the result depend on timer noise and could
force a format the checkpoint does not contain. Quantize the checkpoint explicitly,
then serve that checkpoint without `--auto-quant`.

Start a local OpenAI-compatible inference server:

```bash
# Install server dependencies
pip install "soup-cli[serve]"

# Start server
soup serve --model ./output --port 8000

# With custom settings
soup serve --model ./output --port 8080 --host 127.0.0.1 --max-tokens 1024
```

Endpoints:
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` — chat completions (streaming supported)
- `GET /v1/models` — list available models
- `GET /health` — health check

Compatible with OpenAI SDK:
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="unused")
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="output",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)
```

### KV Cache Quantization (`soup serve --kv-cache-type`)

Shrink the inference-time KV cache on the transformers backend:

```bash
soup serve --model ./output --kv-cache-type bf16   # cache in the model compute dtype
soup serve --model ./output --kv-cache-type q8_0   # 8-bit quantized cache (needs `hqq`)
```

`bf16`/`f16` need no extra dependency; `q8_0` requires a quant backend (`hqq` / `optimum-quanto`) or the CLI exits with an install hint; `fp8` is Hopper-only. Full detail and the vLLM/SGLang status live in [Performance & Quantization → KV Cache Types](performance-and-quantization.md#kv-cache-types-v0530).

### vLLM Backend (2-4x Faster Inference)

Use [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) for significantly better throughput in production:

> **Install `[serve-fast]` in a separate environment from `[train]`.** Their
> accelerator stacks can still resolve different `torch` builds. `soup env
> check` flags an installed package that violates this distribution's declared
> bounds (exit code 3), so you can catch a contaminated venv before a run relies
> on it.

```bash
# Install vLLM support (in its own environment, not the training one)
pip install "soup-cli[serve-fast]"

# Start with vLLM backend
soup serve --model ./output --backend vllm

# Multi-GPU with tensor parallelism
soup serve --model ./output --backend vllm --tensor-parallel 2

# Control GPU memory usage
soup serve --model ./output --backend vllm --gpu-memory 0.8

# Cap the sequence length when the KV cache does not fit
soup serve --model ./output --backend vllm --max-model-len 8192
```

> **Tip:** Soup auto-detects vLLM. When installed, you'll see a hint during `soup serve` if you haven't enabled it yet.

The vLLM backend applies the **model's own chat template**, exactly like the
transformers backend, and encodes the rendered prompt itself so the engine
receives the same token ids Soup trains on rather than re-tokenizing the string.
(The MII backend also tokenizes through a wrapper around the same tokenizer, so
a templated prompt reaches its engine with the ids the template implies, #891.)
A model that ships no chat template falls back to a generic `User:` /
`Assistant:` prompt, and the server says so at startup. `finish_reason` reports `"length"` when a response
hits `max_tokens` and `"stop"` otherwise (`/v1/messages` maps those to
`max_tokens` / `end_turn`).

### SGLang Backend

Use [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) as an alternative high-throughput backend:

```bash
# Install SGLang support
pip install "soup-cli[sglang]"

# Start with SGLang backend
soup serve --model ./output --backend sglang

# Multi-GPU with tensor parallelism
soup serve --model ./output --backend sglang --tensor-parallel 2
```

Like the transformers and vLLM backends, the SGLang backend applies the
**model's own chat template** via the same shared prompt builder (falling back
to a generic `User:` / `Assistant:` prompt for template-less models). When the
template rendered the prompt, Soup encodes it itself and posts the token ids to
the runtime's `/generate` endpoint, so the engine cannot add a second BOS to
the one the template already rendered (#890); the template-less fallback is
still sent as a string and tokenized by the engine as before. `finish_reason`
reports `"length"` when a response hits `max_tokens` and `"stop"` otherwise, so
a client doing continue-on-length can tell a truncated answer from a completed
one (#360).

It also honours `--trust-remote-code` like every other backend. **This changed:**
the SGLang runtime and its tokenizer previously loaded with `trust_remote_code`
hardcoded on, so a model's custom repo code executed whether or not you opted in
— the pre-flight panel announced it but offered no way to decline. A model that
needs custom code now **fails to load** on this backend unless you pass the flag:

```bash
soup serve --model ./output --backend sglang --trust-remote-code
```

### Speculative Decoding

Use a smaller draft model to speed up generation. **Measure before you trust it** — see
[Train + measure your own draft](#train--measure-your-own-draft-soup-draft) below. Speculative
decoding is only a win when the draft agrees with the target often enough to pay for its own
forward pass; on a small target it is frequently a *slowdown*.

```bash
# Transformers backend — uses HF assisted generation
soup serve --model ./output --speculative-decoding small-draft-model --spec-tokens 5

# vLLM backend — uses vLLM native speculative decoding
soup serve --model ./output --backend vllm --speculative-decoding small-draft-model

# Auto-pair: Soup picks the draft for you based on the target family
soup serve --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct --backend vllm --auto-spec
# → auto-paired: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (target: Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct)
```

`--auto-spec` handles Llama 3.1/3.3/4, Qwen 2.5/3, Mistral Large, Mixtral, DeepSeek V3/R1, and Gemma 2/3. Models without a known draft pairing (e.g. 8B-or-smaller targets where draft+target overhead outweighs the gain) print a yellow "no draft" note and fall back to standard decoding. A draft you trained yourself with `soup draft distill` is picked up **before** this built-in table.

Cross-tokenizer speculative decoding is supported on the Transformers backend via Universal Assisted Decoding (UAD). When target and draft models use different tokenizers, Soup loads the draft tokenizer and routes through Transformers' cross-tokenizer candidate generator. This requires a `transformers` version supporting cross-tokenizer assisted decoding (Soup raises a clear error if the installed version lacks this capability). Same-tokenizer pairs continue using the native single-tokenizer assisted generation path.

### Train + measure your own draft (`soup draft`)

The question nobody answers before enabling speculative decoding: *would the draft actually
propose the tokens my model is going to emit?* `soup draft measure` answers it.

```bash
# Would this draft pay off? Acceptance rate + REAL plain-vs-assisted throughput.
soup draft measure --target ./my-tuned-model \
  --draft HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct \
  --prompts prod-prompts.jsonl

# Distil a draft from your own target, then serve it automatically.
soup draft distill --target ./my-tuned-model \
  --draft-base HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct \
  --data traffic.jsonl -o draft/
soup serve --model ./my-tuned-model --auto-spec     # picks up ./draft
soup draft list
```

**Acceptance rate** is the fraction of the target's own greedy tokens the draft would have
proposed correctly (teacher-forced argmax agreement — the metric the Medusa/EAGLE papers report).
Higher is better, and the STRONG / MODERATE / WEAK band (≥70% / ≥50%) grades the rate alone. **It
does not say whether the pair is faster.** That depends on how much faster the draft is than its
target: on the one pair measured at scale (Llama-3.1-8B target, Llama-3.2-1B draft, one H100),
81.3% acceptance was STRONG and assisted generation ran at 0.48x of plain.
`--min-acceptance 0.6` exits **2** below the floor, so CI can gate on it (exit 0 = ok, 2 = below
floor, 1 = error).

**Break-even and draft length.** `measure` also times the draft decoding alone and reports:

- **Latency ratio** `c` = plain tok/s ÷ draft-alone tok/s: what one draft token costs in target
  steps.
- **Break-even acceptance** at the `--num-assistant-tokens` in use: the rate at which assisted
  generation would stop being slower. "None" means no rate pays, which is always the case once the
  draft is no faster than the target.
- **Best k**: the draft length in 1..64 that maximises the modelled speedup at your measured
  acceptance.

These three are **modelled, not measured**. They use the standard expected-tokens model:
per-position acceptance `a` independent across positions, `E = (1 − a^(k+1)) / (1 − a)` tokens per
step at a cost of `k·c + 1` target steps. So they're a ceiling that excludes framework overhead.
On the H100 pair above the model gave 0.955x at k=5 against a measured 0.481x. To measure
instead, add `--sweep-k 1,2,3,5,8` (at most 8 values). It times assisted generation at each k and
reports the measured best k beside the modelled one. The numbers are a single greedy run, and
`soup serve` samples at temperature 0.7 by default, so treat the best k as a starting point.

*Note: For cross-tokenizer drafts, the measured acceptance rate is a strict lower bound. A token boundary merge between the prompt and the first generated token can cause the score to read up to `1/n_gen` lower than its true value, but it will never over-report.*

`distill` runs logit KD through the existing `task: distill` trainer and emits a **dense** model
(a PEFT adapter directory cannot be loaded as an `assistant_model`). When draft and target share a
tokenizer, standard distillation is used. When tokenizers or vocabularies differ, `soup draft distill`
automatically routes through cross-tokenizer Universal Logit Distillation (`uld_strategy: wasserstein_aligned`).
A `soup shrink` output makes a good draft base: same tokenizer by construction.

**Cross-tokenizer measurement.** When tokenizers differ, raw token IDs cannot be compared directly.
`soup draft measure` automatically detects mismatched tokenizers and evaluates acceptance by aligning
decoded character spans (`count_accepted_spans`). For both same-tokenizer and cross-tokenizer pairs,
target generation neutralizes only `repetition_penalty` with `repetition_penalty=1.0` (Refs #345) so that draft proposals
and target continuations are evaluated under consistent argmax rules; other generation processors
(`no_repeat_ngram_size`, `encoder_repetition_penalty`, `min_new_tokens`, `bad_words_ids`, `suppress_tokens`,
and `sequence_bias`) are left untouched. Cross-tokenizer support expands the choice of draft models,
but cross-tokenizer speculative decoding adds tokenization alignment overhead and does not guarantee
a speedup — use `soup draft measure` to verify real throughput on your specific pair.

**Measured reality check (be sceptical of speedup claims, including ours).** On
`SmolLM2-360M-Instruct` with a `SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` draft, the *stock* draft already scored
**69.3%** acceptance, distilling it changed nothing (69.7% after 2 epochs, 69.3% after 10), and
assisted decoding came out **0.55–0.64×** — a net slowdown. A small same-family draft is already
near its ceiling for agreeing with the target, and the draft's forward pass costs more than the
tokens it saves. Whether distillation pays off on a larger or genuinely diverged target/draft pair
is unproven on a 4 GB box. Run `soup draft measure` on *your* pair rather than assuming.

### Prefix Caching

For RAG and agent workloads with a shared system prompt, enable vLLM's automatic prefix cache:

```bash
soup serve --model ./output --backend vllm --prefix-cache
```

The first request with a given prefix warms the cache; subsequent requests skip the shared prefix compute entirely. Big latency win when 100+ requests share the same system prompt.

### Dynamic LoRA Hot-Swap

Switch the active adapter at runtime without restarting the server:

```bash
soup serve --model base-model --adapters chat=./chat-adapter code=./code-adapter
```

```bash
# Activate an adapter
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/adapters/activate/chat
# → {"active": "chat", "status": "ok"}

# Return to base model
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/adapters/deactivate
# → {"active": null, "status": "ok"}

# List loaded adapters with active flag
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/adapters
# → {"adapters": [{"name": "chat", "active": true}, ...], "active": "chat"}
```

Names are validated against `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*$`; activate/deactivate calls are thread-safe behind a lock. Activate/deactivate also check the `Host` and `Origin` headers (see [Server-Side Tool Endpoints](#server-side-tool-endpoints)).

### Multi-Tenant Vector Bank (`soup serve --bank`)

Serve many per-user personas from one model at KB-per-user instead of a full LoRA each.
A VeRA / VB-LoRA bank stores a shared random projection (reconstructed deterministically
from a seed — never stored on disk) plus a small per-user scaling vector. The active user
is chosen **per request** via the `X-User-Id` header:

```bash
# bank.json carries {name, base_model, projection_seed, vector_dim, entries: [{user_id, scaling}, ...]}
soup serve --model base-model --bank ./bank.json --bank-strength 1.0
```

```bash
# Apply alice's persona to this request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "X-User-Id: alice" \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]}'

# No / unknown X-User-Id → zero-delta no-op (plain base model, no cross-request leak)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]}'
```

The per-token delta is `v_user ⊙ (x @ Pᵀ)`, added to the last decoder layer's residual by a
decode-time forward hook. `--bank-strength` scales the delta (magnitude capped at 100). The
`--bank` path must live under your cwd. The active user is resolved **per request** via a
`contextvars.ContextVar`, so concurrent requests on a threaded server never race on shared state
— each request (streaming and non-streaming) gets its own isolated active-user selection, and an
absent / unknown id self-clears to the clean baseline. (v0.71.12 / per-request v0.71.17)

### Serve a Trained MoLE (`soup serve --mole`)

Serve a Mixture-of-LoRA-Experts adapter trained with `task=moe_lora_routing`. The training run
writes a self-describing `mole_manifest.json` next to `mole_gate.pt`; `soup serve --mole <dir>`
loads the base model + the N frozen task LoRAs + the trained gate and blends them **per token**
at decode time (a custom blend loop — both non-streaming and SSE streaming):

```bash
# <dir> is the MoLE training output (contains mole_gate.pt + mole_manifest.json)
soup serve --model ./mole_out --mole ./mole_out --device cuda
```

The base model comes from `--base` if set, otherwise the base recorded in the manifest. `--mole`
requires `--backend transformers` and is mutually exclusive with `--bank` / `--steer` /
`--adapters` / `--speculative-decoding`. The manifest + gate are cwd-contained, symlink-rejected,
and size-capped, and the gate loads with `weights_only=True`. Because the blend recomputes the
sequence each step (no KV cache), this path is best for small / demo models. (v0.71.17)

### Structured Output (JSON Schema / Regex)

Constrain model output to a valid JSON schema or regex pattern:

```bash
# JSON schema (schema file must live under your cwd)
soup serve --model ./output --structured-output json --json-schema product.json

# Regex (length-capped at 2048 chars, null bytes rejected)
soup serve --model ./output --structured-output regex --regex-pattern '\d{3}-\d{4}'
```

The `validate_json_schema` helper caps serialised size at 64KB and requires a top-level `type` field so malformed schemas fail fast at server startup, not per-request.

### Continuous-Batching Dashboard + `/metrics`

Track live server health:

```bash
soup serve --model ./output --dashboard
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics
# → {
#   "requests_total": 1234,
#   "tokens_generated_total": 456789,
#   "active_requests": 3,
#   "latency_p50_ms": 185.2,
#   "latency_p95_ms": 720.0,
#   "latency_samples": 1000
# }
```

`/metrics` is served by the **transformers** and **vLLM** backends (on both,
whether or not `--dashboard` is passed — the flag only records intent). The
**SGLang** and **MII** backends do not expose it; passing `--dashboard` there
prints a warning at startup rather than silently collecting nothing.

Latency percentiles are computed from the last 1000 requests; counters include failure paths so the dashboard shows true reliability, not just success rate.

### OpenTelemetry Request Tracing

Emit per-request spans to your OTLP collector:

```bash
pip install opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp

soup serve --model ./output \
  --trace \
  --trace-endpoint http://localhost:4317
```

The OTLP endpoint is SSRF-hardened: only http/https schemes, plain HTTP only for loopback (`localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`::1`), and RFC1918 / link-local / `0.0.0.0` all rejected via `ipaddress.ip_address`. When the SDK is missing the flag is a no-op with a warning — the server starts fine without spans.

> **Note:** `max_tokens` is capped at 16,384 per request. Error details are never exposed in HTTP responses.


## Web UI

Launch a local web interface to manage experiments, start training, explore data, and chat with models — all from your browser.

```bash
pip install "soup-cli[ui]"
soup ui
# -> opens http://127.0.0.1:7860 in your browser
# -> prints auth token to console
```

> **v0.75.0 and v0.75.1: add the token to the URL yourself.** In these two
> releases the tab `soup ui` opens carries no token, so it shows
> `Error loading dashboard: Unauthorized` and no page can load data (#1194).
> Open `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/?token=<TOKEN>` instead, with the port from
> the startup panel's `URL:` line and the value on its `Token:` line. The page
> keeps the token for that tab, so a reload works, and removes it from the
> address bar; your browser's history still records the URL. A new tab or
> another browser needs the URL again, and the token changes every time
> `soup ui` starts unless you pass `--auth-token`.

**Pages:**
- **Dashboard** — view all experiment runs, loss charts, system info, multi-run comparison
- **New Training** — create configs from templates or 174 ready-made recipes, validate, start training with live SSE log streaming and progress bar
- **Data Explorer** — browse and inspect datasets (JSONL, JSON, CSV, Parquet)
- **Model Chat** — chat with streaming responses, configurable temperature/top_p/max_tokens, system prompt, adapter selection, markdown rendering, chat export

**Live monitoring + enhanced UX:**
- **Training Live Monitor** — real-time SSE log streaming, live metrics, progress bar with ETA
- **Enhanced Metrics** — 2x2 chart grid (loss, LR, grad_norm, throughput) + GPU memory chart, eval results table
- **Multi-Run Compare** — overlay loss curves from up to 5 runs side-by-side
- **Chat Upgrade** — SSE streaming via proxy, typing indicator, cancel button, markdown renderer (bold, italic, code blocks), chat export as JSON
- **Config Builder** — recipe dropdown (174 recipes), config schema API for dynamic form generation

Gradient norm is nullable: backends or steps that do not report it store and
stream `null`, and the Web UI chart leaves a gap instead of drawing a false
zero. An actually logged `0.0` remains a measured value and appears in the
terminal panel.

**Security:** The Web UI generates a random auth token at startup (printed to console). Every private endpoint — mutating (start/stop training, delete runs, inspect data, validate config) and reading (runs, metrics, system, recipes, SSE streams) — requires an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. `/` and `/api/health` stay open so the dashboard can load. CORS is restricted to the served origin. Data inspection is sandboxed to the working directory.

**The token is not kept across reloads.** The page reads the token from `?token=…` (the `--public` phone URL) or asks for it the first time a request is refused, then holds it in page memory only: never `sessionStorage`, `localStorage`, a cookie or a `window` property. A reload or a new tab therefore asks for it again; paste the token `soup ui` printed (the whole `Authorization: Bearer …` line works too). If you cancel the prompt, the page stays signed out until your next click, which asks again. That is deliberate: a token persisted where page script can read it would turn a future rendering mistake into a token disclosure. It does not protect against script already running in the page; the content policy below is the defence there.

YAML-entry request bodies are capped at 1 MiB on `/api/config/validate`,
`/api/train/start`, and `/api/config/from-form`. Larger bodies return HTTP 413
before JSON/YAML validation. The server checks both `Content-Length` and the
bytes actually received, so chunked requests and understated headers cannot
bypass the limit.

**Content policy.** Every Web UI response carries a `Content-Security-Policy` that allows scripts only from the UI's own origin and the pinned Chart.js file (no inline script, no `eval`), plus `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` and `X-Frame-Options: DENY`. Chart.js is loaded with a Subresource Integrity hash, so the browser refuses it if the CDN serves different bytes. The UI's markup carries no inline event handlers, and every server- or dataset-derived value is escaped before it is rendered. The loopback-only `/docs`, `/docs/oauth2-redirect` and `/redoc` pages are the one exception to the policy header, because FastAPI's interactive docs start from an inline script.

**Interactive API docs are loopback-only.** `/openapi.json`, `/docs`, `/docs/oauth2-redirect` and `/redoc` serve on a loopback bind and are **absent** (404) on any other, including `soup ui --public`. This is deliberate rather than incidental: the schema exposes no run data, configuration or logs, but it does describe every route, parameter and request/response shape, and on a LAN bind that is free reconnaissance. Gating them behind the token instead was rejected — `/docs` is a browser navigation and Swagger cannot attach a Bearer header to it, so gating would break the page for a developer while leaving `/openapi.json` readable by any HTTP client. If you need the schema while bound publicly, read it from a loopback instance of the same version.

```bash
# Custom port, don't auto-open browser
soup ui --port 8080 --no-browser
```


## Inference Server Trace Log

`soup serve --trace-log <path>` writes a passive append-only JSONL log per chat completion:

```bash
soup serve --model ./out --trace-log ./serve-trace.jsonl --trace-log-cap-mb 100
```

Each line: `{"ts": ..., "prompt": ..., "response": ..., "latency_ms": ..., "tokens": ...}`. Path-containment validated, hard rotation cap (default 100 MB, one backup retained), symlink-reject on the backup path (TOCTOU defence), and `hf_*` / `sk-*` / `Bearer …` token shapes redacted to `<redacted>` before write. Failures (disk full, serialisation errors) never crash the request handler.


## Soup Quantize — Ergonomic Export Alias

```bash
soup quantize ./out --to gguf --bits 4
soup quantize ./out --to gptq --bits 4 -o ./out-gptq
```

Prints the equivalent `soup export …` invocation (escaped via `shlex.quote`) for copy-paste. Intentionally does NOT in-process call `soup export` — Typer commands aren't safe to re-enter.


## Llama.cpp Proxy

```bash
soup llama --help                  # list supported subcommands
soup llama cli -m model.gguf -p "Hello"
soup llama gguf-split --merge a.gguf b.gguf out.gguf
soup llama server -m model.gguf
soup llama quantize model.gguf model-q4_k_m.gguf q4_K_M
```

### `soup llama quantize`

Forwards every trailing argument to the `llama-quantize` binary on `PATH` (same
closed allowlist / filtered-env rules as the other `soup llama` subcommands). Use
it when you already have a GGUF and want llama.cpp's quantizer directly, rather
than going through `soup export --format gguf` / `soup quantize`.

Closed allowlist: `cli` / `mtmd-cli` / `gguf-split` / `server` / `quantize`. Forwards to `llama-*` binary on PATH (`shutil.which`) with **filtered child env** — `HF_TOKEN` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and other secrets are dropped before exec; only `PATH` / `HOME` / `USER` / locale + llama.cpp-recognised `LLAMA_CPP_HOME` / `GGML_*` / `OMP_NUM_THREADS` are forwarded.


## Tail-Latency Stats + Tool-Call Timer

```python
from soup_cli.utils.tail_latency import summarise_latency
from soup_cli.utils.tool_outputs import ToolOutputsBuffer, ToolCallTimer

stats = summarise_latency([12.3, 14.1, 9.7, 18.8, 11.2])
# TailLatencySummary(count=5, mean=..., p50=..., p95=..., p99=..., ema=...)

buffer = ToolOutputsBuffer()
with ToolCallTimer(buffer, name="fetch_url") as timer:
    timer.set_output("...")
```

Pure-Python EMA + linear-interp percentiles (DoS cap: `MAX_SAMPLES=1_000_000`). `ToolOutputsBuffer` is a thread-safe `collections.deque(maxlen=1000)` ring with truncated previews; `ToolCallTimer` records duration / output / error per invocation for tool-calling SFT runs.


## Web UI Plugin Registry + Env Knobs

```python
# src/soup_cli/ui/plugins/my_tab.py
from soup_cli.ui.plugins import register_tab

def render_my_tab(request) -> str:
    return "<div>my tab body</div>"

register_tab(name="my-tab", title="My Tab", render=render_my_tab)
```

Drop-in plugin registry with kebab-case name allowlist, 32-tab cap, idempotent re-register. Plus `API_HOST` / `API_PORT` / `API_KEY` / `GRADIO_HOST` / `GRADIO_PORT` env knobs for FastAPI + Gradio surfaces.


## Deploy Autopilot

Pick the optimal PEFT + quantisation + speculative-decoding combo for your hardware target in one command:

```bash
soup deploy autopilot --target rtx-4090-24gb --base meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B
# Writes:
#   deploy_autopilot.yaml  — ready-to-train soup.yaml recipe
#   deploy_autopilot.sh    — planned deploy shell script
```

Profiles ship out of the box for Apple Silicon (`mac-m3`, `mac-m4-pro`), consumer NVIDIA (`rtx-3060-12gb`, `rtx-4090-24gb`), mobile (`iphone-16`, `pixel-9`), local runtimes (`ollama-local`, `lm-studio`), and cloud (`runpod-a100`, `hf-jobs-h100`). `--list` shows the full table. Every profile is a frozen dataclass with closed allowlists on runtime / quant / PEFT — bad config values fail at import time. The generated bash uses `shlex.quote` on the model path and writes are protected by cwd containment + `os.lstat + S_ISLNK` TOCTOU rejection.


## Agent Forge

Turn an OpenAPI 3.x, MCP server manifest, or GraphQL introspection JSON straight into a tool-calling SFT dataset — no manual labelling, no scaffolding:

```bash
# 1. Parse spec + synthesise a tool-calling dataset
soup agent synth --spec api.yaml --output ds.jsonl --examples-per-endpoint 4

# 2. Plan the training run (prints the soup train invocation)
soup agent train --spec api.yaml --base meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B

# 3. Score model predictions against the spec catalog
soup agent eval --spec api.yaml --predictions preds.jsonl
```

Each row of the synthesised dataset is `{messages: [user, assistant_with_tool_call], tool: <name>, source_endpoint: <path>}`. `$ref` strings in OpenAPI are left opaque (no external resolution — defends against file-read SSRF), `yaml.safe_load` only, 5 MiB spec cap, 10 000-endpoint cap, atomic JSONL write via staged-tempfile + `os.replace`. `eval` enforces a 1 000 000-line cap on predictions and rejects symlinks at every read/write boundary.


## HF Space SDK Auto-Pick

When you deploy a custom Space template directory, Soup now picks `space_sdk="streamlit"` / `"gradio"` from the rendered `requirements.txt`:

```bash
soup deploy hf-space --space my-org/my-app --model my-org/my-model --template-dir ./my-template
```

If `requirements.txt` lists `streamlit`, the Space is created with the Streamlit SDK. Otherwise (no requirements, gradio listed, etc.), Soup falls back to the Gradio default. The HF Hub allows `docker` and `static` SDKs too, but those cannot be inferred from `requirements.txt` alone — use the built-in templates or supply a custom one with an explicit `--sdk` override.


## Anthropic Messages API Converter

Pure-Python converters between OpenAI chat-completions and Anthropic Messages payload shapes:

```python
from soup_cli.utils.anthropic_messages import to_anthropic, from_anthropic

anthropic_payload = to_anthropic({
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "you are helpful"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "hi"},
    ],
    "max_tokens": 256,
})
```

Multiple `system` messages join with `\n\n`. `tool` role with structured (list) content is concatenated into a single `tool_result` text block, never silently dropped. `max_tokens` capped at 16384, `temperature` bounded `[0.0, 2.0]`. Live `/v1/messages` endpoint inside `soup serve` lands in v0.45.1.


## Server-Side Tools

```python
from soup_cli.utils.server_tools import (
    SUPPORTED_TOOLS, WebSearchConfig, is_domain_allowed, validate_web_search_config,
)

# SUPPORTED_TOOLS == frozenset({"python", "bash", "web_search"})
config = WebSearchConfig(
    domain_allowlist=("example.com", ".docs.example.com"),
    rate_limit_per_minute=30,
)
validate_web_search_config(config)
is_domain_allowed("a.docs.example.com:443", config.domain_allowlist)  # True
is_domain_allowed("[::1]", config.domain_allowlist)                   # False
```

`python` and `bash` reuse the v0.25.0 RLVR sandbox; `web_search` is gated by an explicit domain allowlist (default empty = deny all). `is_domain_allowed` strips `:port` suffixes before matching and rejects IPv6 literals so `Host: api.example.com:443` matches `api.example.com`. Live HTTP tool endpoints in v0.45.1.


## Anthropic Messages Endpoint

`soup serve --backend transformers` and `soup serve --backend vllm` expose
a POST `/v1/messages` route that accepts Anthropic Messages-shaped payloads
(the **SGLang** backend does not — it serves `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/models`
and `/health` only):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/messages -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "model": "my-model",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello"}],
  "max_tokens": 64
}'
```

Non-streaming requests return Anthropic-shaped envelopes. Streaming (`stream: true`)
returns Anthropic event-shape SSE with `message_start` → `content_block_delta` →
`message_delta` + `message_stop` events. Validation errors return a generic
`"Invalid request"` 400 body with details logged server-side at DEBUG. CORS restricted
to loopback-only (`localhost` / `127.0.0.1`) on both backends.


## N-gram Speculative Decoding

When a server is configured with an `NgramSpecConfig`, every chat completion forwards
`prompt_lookup_num_tokens=N` into `model.generate(...)` (HF Transformers ≥ 4.38
prompt-lookup decoding — no draft model required). Mutually exclusive with a real
`assistant_model`; if both are set, the real draft model wins.


## Server-Side Tool Endpoints

v0.53.7 ships live server-side tool calling on `soup serve`.
Three POST routes are now available on `soup serve`:

- **`POST /v1/tools/python`** — runs caller-supplied Python code in an isolated
  sub-process. Bounded by 512 MB memory, 5-second wall-clock timeout, and a
  single-worker concurrency cap.
- **`POST /v1/tools/web_search`** — searches the web and returns domain-filtered results
  as `[{url, title, snippet}]` with snippets sanitized (null bytes stripped).
  Deny-by-default via `WebSearchConfig.domain_allowlist`.

- **`POST /v1/tools/bash`** — runs a bash command with strict OS-level network
  isolation (`unshare` on supported Linux runtimes, `sandbox-exec` on macOS).
  Enforces mandatory Bearer token authentication when bound to a non-loopback host,
  a 5-second wall-clock timeout, a minimal secret-scrubbed environment, and a combined
  10KB stdout/stderr streaming kill limit. Returns the real stdout, stderr, exit code,
  and timeout state. This is not a filesystem sandbox: the child retains the server
  process's read access to world-readable system files. The endpoint fails closed with
  HTTP 501 when strict OS isolation is unavailable (including on Windows or restricted
  Linux containers).

Tool routes, `/v1/thumbs` and adapter activate/deactivate accept requests only when the
`Host` header names the bound address (any loopback name for a loopback bind) and any
`Origin` header names the same; otherwise they answer 421 or 403.

The generation routes (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`) and the adapter listing
(`GET /v1/adapters`) carry the narrower half of that check: a request whose `Origin` names
another site is refused with 403, so a page the operator merely visits cannot drive
generation on their server or enumerate the loaded adapters — CORS alone would only stop
that page *reading* the reply, not sending the request. Requests that carry no `Origin` at
all — curl, the OpenAI/Anthropic SDKs, a reverse proxy — are unaffected, and `Host` is not
checked on these routes, so a proxy can still front them under its own hostname.
